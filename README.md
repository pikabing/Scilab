# Scilab

Scilab is a free and open-source, cross-platform numerical computational package and a high-level, numerically oriented programming language. It can be used for signal processing, statistical analysis, image enhancement, fluid dynamics simulations, numerical optimization, and modeling, simulation of explicit and implicit dynamical systems and (if the corresponding toolbox is installed) symbolic manipulations. Scilab is one of the two major open-source alternatives to MATLAB, the other one being GNU Octave.


Some methods to solve integrals,differential equations, finding out roots of an equation have been implemented.
* Newton-Raphson
* Bisection
* Trapezoidal
* Simpsons
* Euler
* Runge-Kutta

Also, some Data Communication programs have also been implemented:

* FM
* AM
* PSK
* PAM
* ASK
